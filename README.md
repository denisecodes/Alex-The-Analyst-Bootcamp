# Alex The Analyst Bootcamp
This repository contains all the portfolio projects I made while completing Alex The Analyst's Bootcamp on YouTube.

## SQL

I own a Mac so I am using MySQL Workbench to complete the SQL projects. For this reason, I have adapted my code so that it works in MySQL. I ran into errors for some of the code which I have commented on, tried to solve myself and found alternative queries. Hope this repository helps anyone else out there doing this bootcamp also using MySQL :) 

## Excel

For the Excel final project, I created a dashboard and you can see the output below for reference. I plan to work on creating a different or expanding on this dashboard to test my skills in the future.
