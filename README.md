# Alex The Analyst Bootcamp
This repository contains all the portfolio projects I made while completing Alex The Analyst's Bootcamp on YouTube.

## SQL

I own a Mac so I am using MySQL Workbench to complete the SQL projects. For this reason, I have adapted my code so that it works in MySQL. I ran into errors for some of the code which I have commented on, tried to solve myself and found alternative queries. Hope this repository helps anyone else out there doing this bootcamp also using MySQL :) 

## Excel

For the Excel Full Project, I created a dashboard on bike sales and you can see the output below for reference. I plan to work on creating a different or expanding on this dashboard to test my skills in the future.

## Tableau

For the Tableau Full Project, I created a dashboard on 2016 Seattle Airbnb data and you can see the output below for reference. I plan to work on using a different dataset to visualise data in Tableau in the future.

## Power BI

For Power BI, I used [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com/) to access Windows to download Power BI Desktop to complete the project on my Mac. Parallels Desktop provides a 14 Day Free Trial and I recommend using this to learn Power BI for Mac users. For the Full Project, I created a dashboard to analyse data on Data Professional Survey collected by Alex and below is the output. I plan to make use Power BI again to make my own visualisations and dashboard.
