# Alex The Analyst Bootcamp
This repository contains all the portfolio projects I made while completing Alex The Analyst's Bootcamp on YouTube.

## SQL

I own a Mac so I am using MySQL Workbench to complete the SQL projects. For this reason, I have adapted my code so that it works in MySQL. I ran into errors for some of the code which I have commented on, tried to solve myself and found alternative queries. Hope this repository helps anyone else out there doing this bootcamp also using MySQL :) 

## Excel

For the Excel Full Project, I created a dashboard on bike sales and you can see the output below for reference. I plan to work on creating a different or expanding on this dashboard to test my skills in the future.

## Tableau

For the Tableau Full Project, I created a dashboard on 2016 Seattle Airbnb data and you can see the output below for reference. I plan to work on using a different dataset to visualise data in Tableau in the future.

## Power BI

For Power BI, I used [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com/) to access Windows to download Power BI Desktop to complete the project on my Mac. Parallels Desktop provides a 14 Day Free Trial and I recommend using this to learn Power BI for Mac users. For the Full Project, I created a dashboard to analyse data on Data Professional Survey collected by Alex and below is the output. I plan to make use Power BI again to make my own visualisations and dashboard.

## Python

For the Python Data Analyst Projects, I completed both using an IDE that I use personally - PyCharm, instead of Jupyter Notebooks that Alex recommended. I had experience doing webscraping and using APIs to pull data prior to completing the projects through this bootcamp. The projects were a good recap of these skills and I started to learn seaborn and matplotlib to visualise data with the Crypto API project. I plan to expand my python knowledge using DS related libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, plotly, numpy etc. You can find more python projects I have completed on my repository: [100 Days of Code Python](https://github.dev/denisecodes/100-Days-of-Code-Python).
